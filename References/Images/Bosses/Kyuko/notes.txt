[Design]
Black fox or wolf wearing a purple robe with a yellow belt.
Possibly has red eyes?
Animates kind of like Reimu, see Hisoutensoku_Reimu.png in the same folder as this one.

[Fight Details]
Throws needles and cards. Jumps around the arena, trying to dodge and hit the player. Can throw projectiles from the ground or the air.
Later fights could have more advanced and harder to dodge attacks.
Instead of flashing white when hit, should flash transparent like the player does.
Don't use the "slam" sound from other bosses, use the "thud" sound from Knuckles's S3K fight and have her fall to the ground and get back up.
Very agile, will require the player to pay attention unlike the wrecking ball boss.

[Music]
BGZ's fight will use Bad Apple!! (TH04).
Later fights could use Maiden's Capriccio (TH04).
If we bring her back for North Island, she'd use Bad Apple!! (Alstroemeria Records feat. Nomico) and Maiden's Capriccio ~ Dream Battle (TH08) instead.
