# *Sonic the Hedgehog: Isle of Magnetic Artifacts*

*(aka SHIMA)*



**This ReadMe file is a WIP. Will be finished after the source is made live, so keep an eye out!**



Hello! This is the source code for SHIMA, a hack with multiple years of development, and by sheer luck managed to win 1st at SHC2022. The hack has been very dormant as of late, but has been decided that if it is to ever return in ROM Hack form, it will start over in a new source, and thus the idea of publicly archiving the 2022 source code was thrown around, which leads us to here!



------------------------------

The contents within this repository are \*exactly\* how they were as of the source's most recent (non-reverted) commit (dated Dec 1, 2023), with the only further modifications being:



\- Removal of MD-Profiler output files (which bloated the source by over 60MB!)

\- A folder containing various builds of key points throughout the hack's history.

\- The "\_addendums" folder and everything within in it. (Contains useful credit/miscellaneous info not present elsewhere in the repo.)



------------------------------

Those interested in the history of SHIMA might find it a bit disappointing that this repo contains no commit history, but there are two major reasons for this:



1\. For reasons not worth getting into, the repository at a certain point months before SHC22's release was abandoned, and progress continued in another repo with a new owner. This effectively put a split in the commit history between repositories, with the former being owned by a previous team leader who was no longer involved with the project. The newer repo only has a few months of history (mostly SHC crunch) on it compared to the 3 years in the previous.

2\. In addition to the above reason(s), the owner of the newer repo has requested that a new repo be made upon being approached with the request of the source being made public, likely a decision somewhat influenced by the above factors, but it's still not much of a loss anyways due to the aforementioned lack of history it even had.



The contents of this repo are \*exactly\* as they were by the last (non-reverted) commit on `Dec 1, 2023`, with the only further modifications being:

\- Removal of MD-Profiler output files (which bloated the source by over 60MB!)

\- A folder containing various builds as a compensation for the lack of commit history. (TBD)





-----------------------------

*September 2025 update*: One of the former directors, and owner of the first repo, has generously publicly archived their repository! You can view that version [here](https://codeberg.org/Gemini0/s-h-i-m-a-archive), but be warned, what's here is VERY unstable and is only available for archival/historical purposes.
