# *Sonic the Hedgehog: Isle of Magnetic Artifacts* 

*(aka SHIMA)*



This ReadMe file is a WIP.





The contents within this repository are \*exactly\* how they were as of the source's most recent (non-reverted) commit (dated Dec 1, 2023), with the only further modifications being:



\- Removal of MD-Profiler output files (which bloated the source by over 60MB!)

\- A folder containing various builds as a compensation for the lack of commit history. (reasoning will be elaborated in final ReadMe.)

\- The "\_addendum" folder and everything within in it. (Contains useful credit/miscellaneous info not present elsewhere in the repo.)
